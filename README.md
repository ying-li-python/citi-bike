# Citi Bike Ridership Analysis
Citi Bike is NYC's bike sharing program, which is the largest in the nation. With bike ridership documented since 2013, we are interested in generating meaningful insights using interactive visualizations with Tableau. For this analysis, we retrieved 1-year data containing 416,406 rows from August 2018 to August 2019.

### (4) Majority of bike riders are male with 72%, whereas 21% are female and 5.98% unknown. May is the most popular month for both male and females to ride. It does not appear that male:female ratios influence the popularity of start stations for female riders.
