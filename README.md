# Citi Bike Ridership Analysis
Citi Bike is NYC's bike sharing program, which is the largest in the nation. With bike ridership documented since 2013, we are interested in generating meaningful insights using interactive visualizations with Tableau. For this analysis, we retrieved 1-year data containing 416,406 rows from August 2018 to August 2019.
